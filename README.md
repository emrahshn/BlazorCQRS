# BlazorCQRS

The project as the name suggests, represents us to  the basic structure to using the CQRS pattern and Blazor together. Database can be found at Stroopwafels/Server/App_Data/. **Client.Infrastructure** contains all manager classes and their interfaces. And this project has been used as a middleware. All [Mediatr](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) processes together with requests and responses are included in the **Application** project.
